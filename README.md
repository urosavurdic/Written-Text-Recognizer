# Written-Text-Recognizer
Guided project from the Full Stack Deep Learning course (UC Berkeley, 2021). Developed a full-stack application that reads, recognizes, and semantically interprets written text. Model training was performed in Google Colab due to limited local hardware, with trained parameters deployed locally for inference.
